# Deep Learning Specialization - Coursera

Here are my solutions to the programming assignments in the Deep Learning Specialization by [deeplearning.ai](https://www.deeplearning.ai/) on Coursera.


The courses offered are:
1. Neural Networks and Deep Learning
2. Improving Deep Neural Networks: Hyperparameter tuning, Regularization and Optimization
3. Structuring Machine Learning Projects
4. Convolutional Neural Networks Sequence Models

I'm planning to finish them all this month.

If you have doubts regarding the assignments, consider asking in the discussion forums. If that doesn't work out, well, feel free to lurk around here! If you have doubts reagarding my submissions, feel free to contact me here, or on my email - palashsharma891@gmail.com
